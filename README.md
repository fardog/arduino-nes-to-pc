# Arduino NES/SNES Adapter

An Arduino sketch that exposes an NES (and later, SNES) controller(s) to a
connected PC. This is accomplished simply: some newer Arduino boards (such as
the [Leonardo][leonardo] and [Due][due]) can emulate a USB Keyboard/Mouse. This
sketch just maps the controller buttons to keypresses.

Instructions, wiring diagrams, and other info will be provided once this is a
little further along!
